I got the version two of the project up and running again, so I feel comfortable
renaming everything to use tabbycat instead of tabbykat once the CI checks get
going.

For next session the following needs to be done:
  - X Clean up the poor logging throughout the codebase 
  - [] Write another test case
  - [] Write ReadMe for running the tests
